  - **Author:** bkonyi
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-21

- **[#174088](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174088): Use an alternative to `git describe` for `master` version resolution**
  - **Author:** matanlurey
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-21

This is intended to provide a more stable and predictable version number.
