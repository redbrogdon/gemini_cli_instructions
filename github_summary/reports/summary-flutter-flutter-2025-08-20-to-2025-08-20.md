- **[#174001](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174001): [ios][tools] do not print out bonjour key not found in non-verbose mode**
  - **Author:** hellohuanlin
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T22:07:41Z
  - **Description:** This PR fixes an issue where a "bonjour key not found" message was being printed in non-verbose mode, which could be confusing for users. This was happening because the tool was not correctly checking if it should skip the error log. The fix adds a `skipErrorLog` flag to the `runSync` method in `xcode_backend.dart` to prevent the message from being printed when it's not a real error. This addresses issue #172627.

- **[#172732](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/172732): Make sure that an Autocomplete doesn't crash in 0x0 environment**
  - **Author:** ahmedsameha1
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T21:58:38Z
  - **Description:** This PR fixes a crash that would occur when an `Autocomplete` widget was rendered in a zero-sized environment. The fix ensures that the widget can handle being rendered in a `SizedBox.shrink()` without throwing an exception. A test has been added to verify this behavior. This addresses issue #6537.

- **[#174109](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174109): Migrate some files to use WidgetStateProperty**
  - **Author:** ValentinVignal
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T21:40:39Z
  - **Description:** This PR is a follow-up to a previous change and continues the migration from the deprecated `MaterialStateProperty` to the new `WidgetStateProperty`. This change updates several files in the Material library to use the new API, which is part of the ongoing effort to clean up the codebase and remove deprecated APIs.

- **[#174053](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174053): Fix onSelect called twice in DropdownMenuFormField**
  - **Author:** PurplePolyhedron
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T21:39:08Z
  - **Description:** This PR fixes a bug in `DropdownMenuFormField` where the `onSelected` callback was being called twice when a selection was made. This was happening because the callback was being called in both the `onSelectedHandler` and the `field.didChange` method. The fix removes the `onSelectedHandler` and passes `field.didChange` directly to the `onSelected` parameter of the `DropdownMenu`. This ensures that the callback is only called once. This addresses issue #173977.

  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T20:32:34Z
  - **Description:** This PR reverts a previous change that added a `setSemanticsEnabled` API and wired up the iOS accessibility bridge. The revert was necessary because the original change was causing internal tests to fail.

- **[#174081](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174081): [Android] Fix version code override calculation in FlutterPlugin**
  - **Author:** gmackall
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T19:10:21Z
  - **Description:** This PR fixes a bug in the Android build process where the version code was not being calculated correctly when using split-per-abi and a custom Gradle file that modifies the version code. The fix ensures that the version code override is calculated correctly by taking into account any modifications made in the Gradle file. The test harness has also been updated to use a newly created app instead of the hello_world example, and a new test case has been added to cover the scenario where a custom Gradle file is used.

  - **Author:** flutteractionsbot
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-20T13:56:07Z
  - **Description:** This PR fixes a bug in the Windows build process where the architecture check was incorrectly checking the process architecture instead of the OS architecture. This would cause the build to fail on 64-bit systems when running in a 32-bit process. The fix ensures that the check correctly identifies the OS architecture, which allows the build to proceed.
