**[#174673](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174673): Nav bar static components respect ambient MediaQueryData**
  - **Author:** victorsanni
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue where `CupertinoSlidingSegmentedControl` and other static components within `CupertinoNavigationBar` did not correctly respect ambient `MediaQueryData`, leading to incorrect rendering in dark brightness and `Size(0,0)` issues. This ensures that these components now properly inherit and utilize the `MediaQueryData` from their context, resolving issues #174642 and #174771.
