**[#174673](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174673): Nav bar static components respect ambient MediaQueryData**
  - **Author:** victorsanni
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue where `CupertinoSlidingSegmentedControl` in `CupertinoNavigationBar` would render incorrectly in dark mode. This change ensures that the static components of the navigation bar respect the ambient `MediaQueryData`, resolving rendering issues and ensuring that `MediaQuery.of(context)` returns the correct size. This addresses GitHub issues #174642 and #174771.

**[#174707](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174707): fix typo in test documentation #2**
  - **Author:** AbdeMohlbi
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Corrects a typo in the test documentation.

**[#174971](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174971): Update ImageReaderSurfaceProducer.MAX_IMAGES to include the maximum number of retained dequeued images**
  - **Author:** jason-simmons
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Updates the `ImageReaderSurfaceProducer.MAX_IMAGES` constant to account for the maximum number of retained dequeued images. This prevents "client tried to acquire more than maxImages buffers" warnings from `ImageReader_JNI`.

**[#173771](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173771): Impeller: Convert GLProc name field and GLErrorToString to std::string_view**
  - **Author:** DEVSOG12
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Improves the OpenGL error handling and procedure table interface in the Impeller renderer by changing `const char*` to `std::string_view` for better memory safety. This change addresses technical debt by improving string handling in the OpenGL backend and type safety without breaking existing functionality. This addresses GitHub issue #135922.

**[#174892](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174892): Depend on operator overload synthesis for three-way and equality comparisons.**
  - **Author:** chinmaygarde
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Simplifies the codebase by depending on the implicitly generated `operator!=` from `operator==` in a few cases and adds `operator<=>` in some of the more obvious instances. This change is a conservative first pass, with more candidates for conversion to be addressed in the future.

**[#174905](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174905): Define a concept for UniqueObjectTraits.**
  - **Author:** chinmaygarde
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Improves compiler error messages by defining a concept for `UniqueObjectTraits`. Previously, incorrect implementations of the traits would result in mysterious compiler errors far from the instantiation point. Now, the compiler will provide a more precise error message, making it easier to identify and fix the issue.

**[#175081](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175081): Bump engine version for Flutter 3.37**
  - **Author:** eyebrowsoffire
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Bumps the engine version for the Flutter 3.37 release.

**[#175076](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175076): Fix GitHub labeler platform-android typo**
  - **Author:** jmagman
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes a typo in the GitHub labeler configuration for the `platform-android` label. This ensures that pull requests related to Android are correctly labeled.

**[#173892](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173892): [Gradle 9] Removed `minSdkVersion` and only use `minSdk`**
  - **Author:** jesswrd
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Updates the Gradle configuration to only use `minSdk` instead of `minSdkVersion`, as the latter is completely dropped in Gradle 9. This change also removes an AGP version checker that is no longer necessary since the minimum AGP version is now 8.3.

**[#174966](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174966): Cut release branch for Flutter 3.37**
  - **Author:** eyebrowsoffire
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Creates the release branch for Flutter 3.37.

**[#175003](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175003): [ Widget Preview ] Improve --machine output**
  - **Author:** bkonyi
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Improves the `--machine` output for the widget previewer. This change adds `widget_preview.initializing` and `widget_preview.logMessage` events, and also fixes and improves testing of `WidgetPreviewMachineAwareLogger`. This addresses GitHub issue #175002.

**[#174937](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174937): Fix DropdownMenuFormField does not clear text field content on reset â€¦**
  - **Author:** bleroux
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue where `DropdownMenuFormField` would not clear the text field value when the form is reset and `DropdownMenuFormField.initialSelection` is null. This change ensures that the text field is cleared as expected. This addresses GitHub issue #174578.

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ **[#9815](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/9815): [url_launcher] fix: Link widget Tab traversal**
  - **Author:** pedromassango
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue where wrapping a widget, like a button, with the `Link` widget would result in two focusable elements, requiring the user to press Tab twice. This was caused by conflicting semantics between the `Link` and its child. The fix wraps the `Link`'s child in a `MergeSemantics` widget, which combines the semantics of the `Link` and its child into a single node. This change also required an engine-level fix to ensure that the `linkUrl` is correctly propagated when semantics are merged. This addresses issue [#157689](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/157689).
