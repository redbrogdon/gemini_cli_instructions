**[#174673](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174673): Nav bar static components respect ambient MediaQueryData**
  - **Author:** victorsanni
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes issues where CupertinoNavigationBar components, like CupertinoSlidingSegmentedControl, would render incorrectly. This change ensures that the navigation bar's static components correctly respect and use the ambient MediaQueryData from their context, resolving rendering bugs in different brightness settings and preventing layout issues.

**[#174707](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174707): fix typo in test documentation #2**
  - **Author:** AbdeMohlbi

**[#174971](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174971): Update ImageReaderSurfaceProducer.MAX_IMAGES to include the maximum number of retained dequeued images**
  - **Author:** jason-simmons
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Increases the `MAX_IMAGES` constant in the `ImageReaderSurfaceProducer` for Android. This update ensures there is enough capacity in the ImageReader to accommodate the total number of images that may be in use, preventing "client tried to acquire more than maxImages buffers" warnings.

**[#173771](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173771): Impeller: Convert GLProc name field and GLErrorToString to std::string_view**
  - **Author:** DEVSOG12
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Improves the OpenGL error handling and procedure table interface in the Impeller renderer. This change replaces the use of `const char*` with `std::string_view` for GL procedure names and error strings, enhancing memory safety and modernizing the codebase.

ðŸ”¥ **[#174892](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174892): Depend on operator overload synthesis for three-way and equality comparisons.**
  - **Author:** chinmaygarde
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Refactors the engine's C++ code to rely on the compiler's automatic synthesis of `operator!=` from `operator==` and introduces the three-way comparison operator (`<=>`). This modernization effort simplifies the code by removing redundant, manually implemented inequality operators.

**[#174905](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174905): Define a concept for UniqueObjectTraits.**

ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ **[#9815](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/9815): [url_launcher] fix: Link widget Tab traversal**
  - **Author:** pedromassango
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-08
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue on web where using a `Link` widget could result in extra focusable elements, requiring users to press Tab multiple times to navigate through them. This was caused by a conflict in the semantics tree. The fix wraps the `Link` widget's child in a `MergeSemantics` widget, which combines the semantics of the `Link` and its child, resolving the issue. This change addresses GitHub issue #157689. The PR generated significant discussion about the correct way to handle semantics for linked buttons on the web.
