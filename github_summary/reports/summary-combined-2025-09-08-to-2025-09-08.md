- **[#4490](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/pull/4490): Revise the section on documenting private parameters.**
  - **Author:** munificent
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T17:14:47Z
  - **Description:** This PR revises the feature specification for private named parameters, specifically how they should be handled by documentation generators like `dart doc`. The key point is that generated documentation should always show the public name of a parameter, even if the parameter itself is private in the source code. This is because the private name is an implementation detail, and users of the API only care about the public name.

- ðŸ”¥ **[#173885](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173885): Retry "Implements the Android native stretch effect as a fragment shader (Impeller-only)."**
  - **Author:** MTtankkeo
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-27T22:56:00Z
  - **Description:** This PR re-introduces the Android native stretch overscroll effect, implemented as a fragment shader for Impeller. It addresses a previous shader loading issue on the Metal backend by adding `stretch_effect.frag` and a new `StretchEffect` widget. The `OverscrollIndicator` now leverages this shader for a more authentic stretch effect when supported, with fallback to a matrix transform otherwise.

  - **Author:** munificent
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T17:14:47Z
