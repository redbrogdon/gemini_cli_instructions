## dart-lang/language

- **[#4490](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/pull/4490): Revise the section on documenting private parameters.**
  - **Author:** munificent
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T17:14:47Z
  - **Description:** This PR revises the feature specification for private named parameters, specifically how they should be handled by documentation generators like `dart doc`. The key point is that generated documentation should always show the public name of a parameter, even if the parameter itself is private in the source code. This is because the private name is an implementation detail, and users of the API only care about the public name.

  - **Author:** matanlurey
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T22:15:25Z
  - **Description:** This PR improves the cherry-pick workflow by automatically removing cherry-pick labels from pull requests that are not merged. It also adds a comment to the pull request explaining why the label was removed. This helps to prevent confusion and ensures that only merged pull requests are considered for cherry-picking. This closes issue #174056.

  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T20:36:40Z
  - **Description:** This PR adds a test to ensure that pictures are not rasterized when they are clipped out of the final scene. This is an important optimization that prevents unnecessary work and improves performance. The test is part of the web renderer unification effort.

- **[#174182](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174182): [CP-stable][ios][tools] do not print out bonjour key not found in non-verbose mode**
  - **Author:** flutteractionsbot
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T19:51:03Z
  - **Description:** This PR is a cherry-pick to the stable branch. It fixes an issue where an error message about a missing `NSBonjourServices` key was always printed, even in non-verbose mode. This was confusing for developers. The fix ensures that this error is only shown in verbose mode, reducing unnecessary noise in the build output. This fixes issue #172627.
