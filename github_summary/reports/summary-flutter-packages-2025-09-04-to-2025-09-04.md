- **[#9869](https://github.com/flutter/packages/pull/9869): [google_maps_flutter_web] Omit styles when cloudMapId is set**
  - **Author:** WillBLogical
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-04
  - **Description:** Fixes a bug in the web implementation of Google Maps Flutter that caused an error when using a `cloudMapId` with a map style.
