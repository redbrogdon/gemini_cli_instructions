ðŸ”¥ **[#174605](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174605): Allow Passing an AnimationController to CircularProgressIndicator and LinearProgressIndicator**
  - **Author:** dkwingsmt
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-16
  - **Description:** Adds a new `controller` property to `CircularProgressIndicator` and `LinearProgressIndicator`, allowing multiple indicators to be synchronized to a single `AnimationController`. This addresses issue #165741 by enabling coordinated animations, which can be set via a `ProgressIndicatorTheme` for convenience.

**[#175195](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/175195): chore: move engine docs out of engine/ and into docs/**
  - **Author:** jtmcdole
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-16
  - **Description:** Moves engine-specific documentation from the `engine/src/flutter/docs` directory to the top-level `docs/engine` directory. This co-locates them with other documentation and prevents them from being included in the engine's content hash.

  - **Author:** flutteractionsbot
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-16
  - **Description:** Fixes a bug where a cursor would appear in a text field after a swipe gesture, even if the field was not focused. This change, a cherry-pick to the beta channel, ensures the cursor only appears if the `TextField` has focus, resolving issue #173106.
