Flutter desktop developers, we've got a fix for you! We've adjusted the default `CupertinoCheckbox` size on desktop to better match its visual size, eliminating excessive padding. We've also added a new `clearAuthorizationToken` method to the `google_sign_in` package for more control over authentication.
