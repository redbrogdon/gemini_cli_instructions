- **[#278](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/pull/278): Add pub add format guidance**
  - **Author:** gspencergoog
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-04
  - **Description:** Enhances the `pub` tool in the MCP server with more detailed descriptions and capabilities. This update adds guidance on how to add packages from different sources (git, path) and as different types of dependencies (dev, override). It also introduces support for the `pub deps` and `pub outdated` commands, and refactors the tool's implementation to use an enum for the available subcommands.

- **[#279](https://github.com/dart-lang/ai/pull/279): add a GEMINI.md file**
  - **Author:** jakemac53
  - **Merged:** 2025-09-04
  - **Description:** Adds a `GEMINI.md` file to the repository. This file provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its structure, key packages (`dart_mcp`, `dart_mcp_server`), and development conventions. The document is intended to be a "living document" for AI coding agents, encouraging them to keep it updated as the project evolves.
