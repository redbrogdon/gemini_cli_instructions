  - **Author:** stuartmorgan-g
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-26T00:41:25Z
  - **Description:** This PR updates the review agent configuration to prevent it from commenting on `dependency_overrides` in `pubspec.yaml` files. This is a common practice for federated plugin PRs, and the comments were unnecessary noise.
