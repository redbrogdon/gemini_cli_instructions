- ðŸ”¥ **[#173885](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173885): Retry "Implements the Android native stretch effect as a fragment shader (Impeller-only)."**
  - **Author:** MTtankkeo
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-27T22:56:00Z
  - **Description:** This PR re-introduces the Android native stretch overscroll effect, implemented as a fragment shader for Impeller. It addresses a previous shader loading issue on the Metal backend by adding `stretch_effect.frag` and a new `StretchEffect` widget. The `OverscrollIndicator` now leverages this shader for a more authentic stretch effect when supported, with fallback to a matrix transform otherwise.

- **[#173263](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/173263): Drawer barrier non dismissible with the escape key**
  - **Author:** romanejaquez
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-27T19:52:35Z
  - **Description:** Fixes an issue where the escape key could dismiss a `Drawer` even when `drawerBarrierDismissible` was set to `false`. This change updates the `_DismissDrawerAction` to respect the `drawerBarrierDismissible` flag, ensuring that the escape key only closes the drawer when intended. New tests confirm the correct behavior for both dismissible and non-dismissible drawer barriers.

- **[#174456](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/174456): [web] Raster Pictures at full screen size in Skwasm**
  - **Author:** harryterkelsen
  - **Merged:** 2025-08-27T19:44:16Z
  - **Description:** Unifies the web rasterization process by making Skwasm raster pictures at the full screen size rather than their individual `cullRect` size. This change simplifies the rendering pipeline by eliminating the need to resize the `bitmaprenderer` canvas for each picture, contributing to the web renderer unification effort and potentially improving performance. The `clipPicture` functionality has been removed as part of this change.
